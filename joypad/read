default button player 1
Move down:	Button 5 (= X-Button)
Move up:	Button 1 (= B-Button)
Attack 1:	Button 2 (= A-Button)
Start:		Button 4 (= Y-Button)

So Attack 1 and Start can be used to confirm settings.
Move Up and Down is for selection.

This is a minimal working joypad config to easy setup a connected controller
Hope it will be usefull!
